# Open COVID19 Map 🦠😷🗺️

## About

Hi, I'm Daniel Karl 🙋🏻‍♂️

I wanted to see whether I can reproduce the Johns Hopkins map visualization of COVID19. Therefore I set out to build my own version 👨🏻‍💻 using the very same live data source that they kindly provide in their GitHub repo 🙏🏻.

Thanks to the already available data set the process of ramping up a visualization tool in React went fairly smooth ☘️. Since then, https://covid19map.io is getting more and more features:

- project the confirmed cases at global average testing rate 🌍🧪👩🏾‍🔬
- display the momentum of the spread 🦠📈🗺️ in glyphs directly, i.e. change over the last 1, 3 or 7 days
- containment score 🏡😷📉 reflecting the spread of COVID19 in a region, based on weighted average growth of confirmed cases over the past 1, 3 and 7 days.
- replay mode 🎟️🎥🎬 to go back in time (also works in momentum mode)
- works with Johns Hopkins data version 1 and 2 (they changed their format on 03/23/2020)
- normalize data by population 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦📊👫
- is open source ⭐😍🥰, therefore allows other researchers 🔬🧑🏾‍🔬🧬 to study this source code and contribute more features

Please check it out, and hopefully it helps to drive more ideas and to provide a better understanding of the situation we are currently facing. We are all in the same boat ⛵ help each other ❤️ stay healthy!

If you want to contribute a feature I will roll out your pull request timely and add your name here.
