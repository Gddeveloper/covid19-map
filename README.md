# COVID19 Map

# About

Hi, I'm Daniel Karl.

In my humble opinion the John Hopkins map of COVID19 is a little distorted for
multiple reason. Therefore I set out today, to build a map that is more realistic 
using their very same dataset. 

It looks like the John Hopkins map is exaggerating a bit, and maybe makes people more afraid than necessary.
I will continue to build this more realistic map. Please start looking at this one instead.
